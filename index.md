# 🧬 Welcome to OMNIA Lab – Omics and Multilevel Integrative Analysis Laboratory

We are a computational biomedical research lab exploring how different layers of biology fit together at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in Santiago, Chile.
Using multi-omics data, quantitative methods, and integrative modeling, we study complex disease phenotypes across molecular, clinical, and cognitive levels.
Our work sits at the intersection of biomedical informatics, neurology, and engineering. We develop and apply methods to make sense of high-dimensional biological data, with a strong focus on rigor, reproducibility, and mechanistic insight 🧠📊.

OMNIA Lab is home to students and researchers from diverse backgrounds, curious about biology, data, and how combining multiple perspectives can lead to better science.
We value collaboration, open science, and thoughtful methodological development – and we're always excited about new ideas (and good plots).
