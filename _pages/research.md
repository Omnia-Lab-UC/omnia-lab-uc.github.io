Our main topics involve 

- **Integrative multi-omics of environmental exposures.**
Environmental exposures contribute substantially to interindividual variation in health and disease.
We use integrative multi-omics approaches to characterize how diverse exposures are biologically embedded across molecular layers, with particular attention to sex-specific effects.
Our work aims to generate mechanistic hypotheses linking exposure profiles to downstream biological pathways, including projects on tobacco smoke, occupational exposures, and other environmental stressors.

- **Multi-omics characterization of sex differences in neurodegenerative disease.**
Sex differences are a major source of heterogeneity in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, yet their molecular bases remain poorly resolved.
We apply integrative multi-omics analyses to identify sex-specific molecular signatures associated with disease risk, progression, and phenotypic variation.
This work emphasizes mechanistic insight across molecular, clinical, and cognitive levels.

- **Cross-cutting: Ethical and societal dimensions of integrative omics research.**
The rapid expansion of multi-omics and integrative biomedical research raises important ethical, social, and epistemological questions.
We engage with these issues by examining how biological knowledge production intersects with environmental injustice, climate-related change, and social inequities.
This work draws on interdisciplinary bioethics perspectives to inform responsible and context-aware biomedical research.
